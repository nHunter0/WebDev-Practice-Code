#Infomation about repository 
This is a collection of some of my web development code and projects that I have written whilst learning:
XML, XSD, XSL, XSLT, DTD, HTML, JSON, CSS and JAVA SCRIPT.

# Note
Some code requires LocalHost.
LocalHost can be run with Python as such: python -m http.server 8000 -d "C:\location"
